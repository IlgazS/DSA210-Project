# DSA210 Course Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the DSA210: Introduction to Data Science course at Sabanci University during the Fall semester of 2024. In this project, I analyze my personal YouTube watch history to gain insights into my viewing patterns. The analysis involves extracting the watch history data from an HTML file provided by Google, cleaning the data, and performing exploratory data analysis to explore various trends and habits related to my YouTube usage.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis comes from my YouTube account. Google provides the watch history data in an HTML format, which is accessible through the [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) service.

The data is processed using a [Python script](YouTube_Watch_History_Data_Extraction.ipynb) that extracts information from the HTML file and converts it into a structured dataframe for analysis.
